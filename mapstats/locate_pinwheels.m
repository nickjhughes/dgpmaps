function [pinw, windno] = locate_pinwheels(map)
%LOCATE_PINWHEELS Locate pinwheels in an OP map.
%
% [pinw, windno] = locate_pinwheels(map)
%
% Finds the location and winding number of all pinwheels in the given OP map
% in complex form.
% 
% Notes:
%
% - The sign of a pinwheel is defined positive if the orientation increases
%   clockwise and negative if anticlockwise. This seems to be the adopted
%   convenion in neuroscience, but unfortunately it is the opposite of the
%   one used in physics!
%
% - The positive (pinwp) and negative (pinwn) pinwheel locations can be
%   obtained as follows:
%     pinwp = pinw(windno > 0,:);
%     pinwn = pinw(windno < 0,:);
%   In principle, the winding number should be either 1 or -1 for all
%   pinwheels (and 0 for non-pinwheel points), but it might happen that it
%   is ±2 or higher for a pinwheel. I don't think that has ever happened to
%   anyone with OR maps, but keep an eye on it!
