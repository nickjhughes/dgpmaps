# Estimating cortical feature maps with dependent Gaussian processes

MATLAB code for the methods presented in the paper:
Hughes, NJ and Goodhill, GJ (2016) Estimating cortical feature maps with dependent Gaussian processes.

Additional functions for analysing feature maps are avaialble at https://github.com/nickjhughes/feature-map-stats.

## Usage
Examples of use are given in `examples.m`.

## Requirements
- Tested with MATLAB R2014b.
- Fast 2-D convolution (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22619-fast-2-d-convolution).
- To measure contour intersection angles: Fast and Robust Curve Intersections (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11837-fast-and-robust-curve-intersections).
- To generate elastic net maps: Generalised Elastic Net Matlab Toolbox (http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/research/EN.html).
- To plot figures: export_fig (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig).
